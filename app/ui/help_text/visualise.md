Plot an MDS (multidimensional scaling) arrangemet of concepts using their vector representations. Enter a list of concepts in the text box. Maximum of 20 items. Change the distance measure and whether to connect concept points with lines using the drop-downs.

For Euclidean and Minkowski-3 distances, classical metric MDS is used. For cosine and correlation distances, nonmetric MDS is used.

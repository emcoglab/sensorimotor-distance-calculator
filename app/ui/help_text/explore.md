Plot a t-SNE arrangement of all sensorimotor concepts. Select the distance type from the drop-down. Chose whether to colour points by dominance in perceptual, action or sensorimor components.

Click an entry in the legend to hide those points; double-click to hide other points. Mouse-over the plot to show other controls.

This is a large graph and can take a few seconds to load: please be patient!

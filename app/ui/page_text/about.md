The **Sensorimotor Distance Calculator** is a tool to calculate semantic distance between words/concepts in an 11-dimension sensorimotor space, comprising six perceptual modalities (touch, hearing, smell, taste, vision, and interoception) and five action effectors (mouth/throat, hand/arm, foot/leg, head excluding mouth/throat, and torso). 

The sensorimotor space is based on ratings from the **Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms**, gathered from a total of 4,558 participants for 39,707 concepts.
A full explanation of the norms can be found in [this Lynott et al. (2019) open-access publication](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-019-01316-z), alongside [an online tool to search and display the norms]((https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/lsnorms/). The full dataset behind the norms can also be [downloaded](http://osf.io/7emr6/).

Both this distance calculator and the norms provide a valuable resource to researchers in diverse areas including psycholinguistics, grounded cognition, cognitive semantics, knowledge representation, machine learning, and big data approaches to the analysis of language and conceptual representations.

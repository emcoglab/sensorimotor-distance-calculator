Experimental design and computational modelling across the cognitive sciences rely on measures of semantic similarity between words/concepts. This page links to the Sensorimotor Distance Calculator, a tool for easily calculating and visualising sensorimotor distances between concepts, featuring coverage of nearly 800 million word pairs.

The sensorimotor distance between words is calculated using the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms, a database of experiential strength ratings across 11 perceptual and action-effector dimensions for nearly 40,000 concepts.

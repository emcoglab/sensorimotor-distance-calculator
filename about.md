The *Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms* are norms of sensorimotor strength for 39,707 concepts across six perceptual modalities (touch, hearing, smell, taste, vision, and interoception) and five action effectors (mouth/throat, hand/arm, foot/leg, head excluding mouth/throat, and torso), gathered from a total of 4,558 participants.

These norms provide a valuable resource to researchers in diverse areas including psycholinguistics, grounded cognition, cognitive semantics, knowledge representation, machine learning, and big data approaches to the analysis of language and conceptual representations.

Use the tabs above to select the different modes of operation.

A full explation of the norms can be found in [this publication](https://osf.io/v9j6q/), alongside an [online tool to search and display the data](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/lsnorms/). The full dataset behind the norms can be [downloaded](http://osf.io/7emr6/).
